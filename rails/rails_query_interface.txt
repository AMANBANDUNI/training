1) Retrieving a Single Object
  Active Record provides several different ways of retrieving a single object.

1.1 find
  Using the find method, you can retrieve the object corresponding to the specified primary key that matches any supplied options. 
For example:

# Find the product with product id = 2.

> ap Product.find(2)

  The SQL equivalent of the above is:

  SELECT * FROM products WHERE (products.id = 2) LIMIT 1

  Note: The find method will raise an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception if no matching record is found.

> ap Product.find([1,3])

  The SQL equivalent of the above is:

  SELECT * FROM products WHERE (products.id IN (1,3))

1.2 find_by
  Using the find method, you can retrieve the object corresponding to the specified primary key that matches any supplied options.
  For example:

# Find one product detail whose description = 'camera'
  > ap Product.find_by(description: "camera")

  This is equivalent to:
  > ap Product.where(description: "camera").take

  Note: The find method will not raise an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception, if no matching record is found it will return nil.

  The find_by! method behaves exactly like find_by, except that it will raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound if no matching record is found. 
  For example:

  > ap Product.where(description: "description").take!	  ||	> ap Product.find_by!(description: "description")
 
  ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound



2) Conditions:

  The where method allows you to specify conditions to limit the records returned, representing the WHERE-part of the SQL statement. 
  Conditions can either be specified as a string, array, or hash.

  2.1) 
    > ap Product.where("description =?","camera")

    The SQL equivalent of the above is:
    SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE (description ='camera')


    #or  
    > ap Product.where(description: "camera")
    #or
    > ap Product.where("description"=>"camera")

  2.2) AND, OR, NOT conditions

    > ap Product.where("description= :name OR category_id= :id",{name: "camera",id: 2})
    
    The SQL equivalent of the above is:
    SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE (description= 'camera' OR category_id= 2)


    #or
    > ap Product.where(description: "camera").or(Product.where(category_id: 2))

    The SQL equivalent of the above is:
    SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."description" = $1 OR "products"."category_id" = $2)  
	[["description", "camera"], ["category_id", 2]]



    NOT Condition: It will list all the Products except the products with id=2 or 3.

    > ap Product.where.not(id: [2,3])
    
    The SQL equivalent of the above is:
    SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE "products"."id" NOT IN ($1, $2)  [["id", 2], ["id", 3]]
