# Loops

Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times.

Loops can also be sub divided in 2 parts:
i) Condition based repetition => Which repeats until the specific condtion returns true. [e.g. while loop]

ii) Range based repetition => Which repeats in a specific range mentioned. [e.g. for loop]


There are 10 statements which we will use in loops in ruby.

1) Ruby while statment
	Syntax:
		while <conditional> do
		   code
		end 

	Note: Executes code while conditional is true. A while loop's conditional is separated from code by the
		 reserved word do, a newline, backslash \, or a semicolon ;.


2) Ruby while modifier
	Syntax:
		<code> while <condition>

			OR

		begin 
		  <code> 
		end while <conditional>


	Note: Executes code while conditional is true.

		If a while modifier follows a begin statement with no rescue or ensure clauses, 
		code is executed once before conditional is evaluated.
