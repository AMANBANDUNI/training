# Lables in js loops / loop control:

Using Labels to Control the Flow:
        Starting from JavaScript 1.2, a label can be used with break and continue to control the flow more precisely.
        A label is simply an identifier followed by a colon (:) that is applied to a statement or a block of code.
        We will see two different examples to understand how to use labels with break and continue.

Note − Line breaks are not allowed between the ‘continue’ or ‘break’ statement and its label name. Also,
        there should not be any other statement in between a label name and associated loop.
